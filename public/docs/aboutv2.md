# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy Cumine, I'm a software engineer and engineering manager at [Second Nature](https://secondnature.io).

As an engineering manager my main focus is providing an environment for my team to perform at their best, while facilitating the planning, coordination, and execution of product technical and engineering goals.

As a software engineer I look to learn from as many people as possible, use the best tool for the job at hand, and build fun things.

## My software engineering journey so far

I studied mechanical engineering at university and enjoyed software engineering module of the course the most. Having decided I wanted to become a software engineer professionally, I attended [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) for 3 months in 2014.

From Makers Academy I joined [Red Badger](https://red-badger.com/) and worked as a software engineer there until 2020.

I joined [Second Nature](https://secondnature.io) in 2021 as an engineering manager.
